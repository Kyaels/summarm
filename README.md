# SUMMARM - Super Ultra Mega Moon Adventure Rescue Mission

## Description

This game is inspired by Atari's arcade game "Lunar Lander." It is written using Verilog and runs on an FPGA and a VGA monitor. In the game, the player controls a rocket ship's accelerator engines. The goal of the game is to successfully land on one of the five platforms. However, crashing on non-platform land or landing too quickly will lose the game.
